Update 1:

For this assignment, the maze rooms and teleport planes have been set up, using Synty assets and FX. The first corridor now showcases the key that can be grabbed as well as the door that opens with it. There is also a glow effect for objects which are interactable that starts when players get close. Lighting needs fixing and need to populate other main rooms / corridors and box rooms with props.

After the initial checkpoint video, I spend a considerable time trying to get the lighting done in closed spaces. I added unique props to 9 different box rooms that the player could visit in the maze. I added a special crystal key for the win-state room which was hidden in one of the box rooms. 

For every other door, the player is only able to open doors using the (basic) key.
